Reduced version of RadioAnalysis for GRAND reconstruction and modifications based on simulations
Will mainly contain the main files needed for these purposes while leaving out the rest of the repository

Old README

This README needs to be extended with time.

Some pip modules needed (install with pip --user install <module>):

- iminuit, lmfit, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, ray

External packages needed: 

 - radiotools (https://github.com/nu-radio/radiotools.git)
 - GRANDlib (for any interactions with simulations processed by GRAND or measurement data)
 - electric field reconstruction (for realistic ADC trace simulations and measurement data)
 - PWF_reconstruction (for reconstruction of arrival direction)

Clone them (with "git clone") and add them to your PYTHONPATH enviourmental variable

You have to add the root path of this project to your PYTHONPATH, i.e.,
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/RadioAnalysis
